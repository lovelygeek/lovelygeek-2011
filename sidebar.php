		<strong>Released:</strong> November 2009<br />
		<p>Joshua <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Cristina is my wedding web site. It was built to give information to wedding guests about the wedding, as well as documenting my DIY projects for the wedding. As a web designer, I had a hard time finding other wedding web sites for inspiration that weren't based off the template builders from wedding web sites. I keep this site up as a place of inspiration for other future geeky bride-to-be designers.</p>

		<h2>About</h2>
		<strong>Released:</strong> January, 16th, 2010<br />
		<p>Here to Help Learning is a K-8 home-school business owned by Beth Mora in El Dorado County. She had previously hired a web designer and felt frustrated because they could not catch her vision for what she had wanted. I did a full redesign of her site, and I continue to maintain it twice a year, updating the classes. In addition to the web site, I film the end-of-the-semester drama performances.</p>
		<p class="btn-work"><a href="http://heretohelplearning.com">View Live Site &raquo;</a></p>

		<h2>Testimony</h2>
		"Cristina, Thank you so much for the creation of my web site. I appreciated your attention to detail that made our web site standout among our competition. I have received numerous compliments about the web site from my customers as they have noted how user friendly, informative and enjoyable our web site is to explore. It has definitely increased our business. I had hired a web designer prior to our business relationship and felt very frustrated because she could not seem to catch my vision for what I wanted. You listened very carefully to my business needs and translated them in to an amazing web site for a small business owner. I feel I can compete with the pros!”
